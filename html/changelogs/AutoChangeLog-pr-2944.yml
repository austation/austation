changes: 
  - balance: "Buckshot - Reduced raw damage from 12.5 to 9. Decreased spread from 25 to 10 degrees."
  - balance: "Soporific - First shot now applies 8 seconds of confusion. If hitting a confused target, will put them to sleep for 5 seconds (Old effect: 5 seconds sleep)."
  - balance: "Meteor Slug - Hard stun reduced from 8 seconds to 2 seconds. Stun is applied if the target hits a wall due to knockback of the shell."
  - balance: "Frag12 - 5 seconds of paralysis reduced to 1 second. Not that it really matters since these are generally going to be a 1 hit kill from the explosion or at least limbs will be lost."
  - balance: "Rubbershot - Reduced stamina damage from 11 to 9. Reduced variance from 25 to 20"
  - balance: "Incapacitating Shell - Reduced variance from 25 to 20, stamina damaged reduced from 6 to 5"
  - balance: "Laser Slug - Reduced damage from 15 to 10. (This thing was ridiculous before and actually pretty easy to make)"
  - balance: "Shotguns - Pump-action shotguns now require the pumping hand to be empty."
  - balance: "Mech Scattershot - Pellet damage reduced from 24 to 18."
  - balance: "Slugs now have an armour penetration of -60, making them very effective against unarmoured targets but not armoured targets."
