  - tweak: "Increased plasma to tritium rate in radiation collectors from 0.001 to 0.01, this means that a standard plasma tank at 303 kPA (or 10 moles) will be completely converted into tritium at just over 30 minutes, requiring it to be replaced in order to generate electricity, fill the plasma tanks or make the plasma colder to fit more into the tank."
