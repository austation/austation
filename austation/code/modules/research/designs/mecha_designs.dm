	desc = "The result of many complaints from disgruntled miners and equally as many complaints from disgruntled roboticists of the lack of reliable ways to combat lavaland megaphauna. The MKA-27 was produced by a team of NT scientists and hacked into the protolathe databases. Although never approved by central command, few can argue against the costs the MKA-27 saves compared to constantly rebuilding mechs and hiring new miners."
